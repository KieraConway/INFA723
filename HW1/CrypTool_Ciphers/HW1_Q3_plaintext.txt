Ciphertext only. One possible attack under these circumstances is the brute-force 
approach of trying all possible keys. If the key space is very large, this becomes 
impractical. Thus, the opponent must rely on an analysis of the ciphertext itself, 
generally applying various statistical tests to it. Known plaintext. The analyst may 
be able to capture one or more plaintext messages as well as their encryptions. 
With this knowledge, the analyst may be able to deduce the key on the basis of the 
way in which the known plaintext is transformed. Chosen plaintext. If the analyst 
is able to choose the messages to encrypt, the analyst may deliberately pick 
patterns that can be expected to reveal the structure of the key.
