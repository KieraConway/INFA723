<h1 align="center"> Homework Assignments </h1>


INFA723 homework assignments are divided into two tracks: Track A and Track B. For each homework assignment, pick either Track A or Track B to work on. You are only required to choose ONE  homework assignment from Track A or Track B, not both.

- <i>Track A</i> assignments are traditional homework assignments. Each assignment will include questions and labs to be answered. Track A will not include programming assignments.

- <i>Track B</i> assignments are more challenging assignments. Each assignment will include open-ended questions and programming assignments.

We will have four homework assignments this semester. For each assignment, you can choose either to work on Track A problems or Track B problems. You can make a choice every time when a homework assignment is available. In other words, you can choose Track A for homework 1 assignment, Track B for homework 2 assignment, etc. Each homework assignment will have the same weight in the final grade whether it is in Track A or Track B.
