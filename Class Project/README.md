<h2 align="center"> AI for Penetration Testing: <br> Exploring the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity <br></h2>

### Overview
This repository contains the documentation and resources for our INFA723 research project, focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in penetration testing (PT). The rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, with its complex and labor-intensive strategies, has greatly benefited from the growing prominence of AI technology in recent years. Most notably, AI has proven crucial for cybersecurity endeavors such as PT, as it levels the playing field and enables defenders to effectively anticipate and mitigate threats.
