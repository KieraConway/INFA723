<h3> Lab Overview </h3>

This homework includes 4 labs listed as below:
- [Lab 1: Set up OpenSSL Testing Environment (Optional if you already have an OpenSSL environment)](#lab-1)
- Lab 2: OpenSSL Command Line
- Lab 3: Send/Receive a File through a Socket Connection
- Lab 4: Use OpenSSL Crypto Library to Encrypt/Decrypt a File and Send/Receive through a Socket Connection
<br><br>


<h3> Lab Preparation and Requirements </h3>

- If you already have an OpenSSL testing environment on your computer:
  - Skip Lab 1.
  - Open your Linux terminal and type the command:
    ```
    $ uname -a
    ```
  - Copy the output to a file and include it as part of your homework assignment.

- If you do not have a Linux machine or an OpenSSL environment:
  - Follow Lab 1 to set up an OpenSSL testing environment.
  - You can install a Linux virtual machine (e.g., using VMWare Workstation Player) on your Windows computer or request a Linux VM from the IALAB.
  - You need an OpenSSL environment before you can continue Lab 2, Lab 3, and Lab 4.

- For each lab (except Lab 1), there are question sections at the end of the labs. 
  - Answer all the questions in each lab.
  - The tutorials in the labs are for your practice.
  - You donâ€™t need to include screenshots for your practice in the homework solution.
